This plugin is a home for various patron related Template Toolkit functions
to help streamline Koha and to move logic from the Perl code into the
Templates when it makes sense to do so.

To use, first, include the line '[% USE Borrowers %]' at the top
of the template to enable the plugin.

For example: [% IF Borrowers.IsDebarred( borrower ) %]
removes the necessity of setting a template variable in Perl code to
find out if a patron is restricted even if that variable is not evaluated
in any way in the script.
