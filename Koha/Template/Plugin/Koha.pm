This plugin contains various Koha replated Template Toolkit functions
to help streamline Koha and to move logic from the Perl code into the
Templates when it makes sense to do so.

To use, first, include the line '[% USE Koha %]' at the top
of the template to enable the plugin.

For example: [% IF Koha.Preference( 'MyPreference ) == 'SettingA' %]
removes the necessity of setting a template variable in Perl code for
each and every system preference, even if no evaluation of the setting
is necessary.

    my ( $self, $pref ) = @_;
