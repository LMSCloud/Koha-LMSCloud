=head1 NAME

Koha::Middleware::SetEnv - Plack middleware to allow SetEnv through proxied headers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  builder {
      ...
      enable "Koha::Middleware::SetEnv";
      ...
  }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds a Plack middleware to convert C<X-Koha-SetEnv> request headers to actual
environment variables.

This is needed because Plackified Koha is currently connected to Apache via an HTTP proxy, and
C<SetEnv>s are not passed through. Koha uses SetEnvs to pass memcached settings and per-virtualhost
styles, search limits and syspref overrides.

=head1 CAVEATS

Due to how HTTP headers are combined, if you want to set a value with an embedded comma, it must be
escaped:

  SetEnv OVERRIDE_SYSPREF_LibraryName "The Best, Truly the Best, Koha Library"
  RequestHeader add X-Koha-SetEnv "OVERRIDE_SYSPREF_LibraryName The Best\, Truly the Best\, Koha Library"

=head1 NOTES

This system was designed to use a single header for reasons of security. We have no way of knowing
whether a given request header was set by Apache or the original client, so we have to clear any
relevant headers before Apache starts adding them. This is only really practical for a single header
name.
