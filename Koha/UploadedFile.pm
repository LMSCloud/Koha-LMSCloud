=head1 NAME

Koha::UploadedFile - Koha::Object class for single uploaded file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Koha::UploadedFile;

    # store record in uploaded_files
    my $upload = Koha::UploadedFile->new({ [columns and values] });

    # get a file handle on an uploaded_file
    my $fh = $upload->file_handle;

    # get full path
    my $path = $upload->full_path;

    # delete uploaded file
    $upload->delete;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows regular CRUD operations on uploaded_files via Koha::Object / DBIx.

The delete method also takes care of deleting files. The full_path method
returns a fully qualified path for an upload.

Additional methods include: file_handle, httpheaders.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=head3 delete

Delete uploaded file.
It deletes not only the record, but also the actual file (unless you pass
the keep_file parameter).

Returns number of deleted records (1 or 0E0), or -1 for unknown.
Please keep in mind that a deleted record does not automatically imply a
deleted file; a warning may have been raised.
(TODO: Use exceptions.)

sub delete {
    my ( $self, $params ) = @_;

    my $name = $self->filename;
    my $file = $self->full_path;

    my $retval = $self->SUPER::delete;
    if( !defined($retval) ) { # undef is Unknown (-1)
        $retval = -1;
    } elsif( $retval eq '0' ) { # 0 => 0E0
        $retval = "0E0";
    } elsif( $retval !~ /^(0E0|1)$/ ) { # Unknown too
        $retval = -1;
    }
    return $retval if $params->{keep_file};

    if( ! -e $file ) {
        warn "Removing record for $name within category ".
            $self->uploadcategorycode. ", but file was missing.";
    } elsif( ! unlink($file) ) {
        warn "Problem while deleting: $file";
    }
    return $retval;
}

    $self->{_file_handle}->binmode;
