=head1 NAME

Koha::SearchEngine::Elasticsearch::Indexer - handles adding new records to the index

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $indexer = Koha::SearchEngine::Zebra::Indexer->new();
    $indexer->index_records( $record_numbers, $op, $server, $records);


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

    This is a dummy function to create the object. C4::Biblio->ModZebra is doing the real work
    now and needed variables are passed to index_records

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift @_;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@_);
}

=head2 index_records($record_numbers, $op, $server, $records)

    This is simply a wrapper to C4::Biblio::ModZebra that takes an array of records and
    passes them through individually

    The final parameter $records is not used in Zebra, it exists for parity with Elasticsearch calls

=cut

sub index_records {
    my ( $self, $record_numbers, $op, $server, $records ) = @_;
    $record_numbers = [$record_numbers] if ref $record_numbers ne 'ARRAY' && defined $record_numbers;
    foreach my $record_number ( @$record_numbers ){
        ModZebra( $record_number, $op, $server );
    }
}
