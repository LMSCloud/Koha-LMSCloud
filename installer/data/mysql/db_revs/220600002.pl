q|110$a was added as a default mapping for biblio.author in MARC21. This will only change the mapping on new installations. If you wish to change the mappings on your existing installation, go to Administration > Koha to MARC mapping and add 110$a to biblio.author and then run batchRebuilBiblioTables.pl.|;
