=head1 NAME

C4::Stats - Update Koha statistics (log)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use C4::Stats;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functions of this module deals with statistics table of Koha database.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 UpdateStats

  &UpdateStats($params);

Adds an entry to the statistics table in the Koha database, which acts as an activity log.

C<$params> is an hashref whose expected keys are:
    branch             : the branch where the transaction occurred
    type               : the type of transaction (renew, issue, localuse, return, writeoff, payment
    itemnumber         : the itemnumber of the item
    borrowernumber     : the borrowernumber of the patron
    amount             : the amount of the transaction
    other              : sipmode
    itemtype           : the type of the item
    accountno          : the count
    ccode              : the collection code of the item

type key is mandatory.
For types used in C4::Circulation (renew,issue,localuse,return), the following other keys are mandatory:
branch, borrowernumber, itemnumber, ccode, itemtype
For types used in C4::Accounts (writeoff, payment), the following other keys are mandatory:
branch, borrowernumber, itemnumber, ccode, itemtype
If an optional key is not provided, the value '' is used for this key.

Returns undef if no C<$param> is given

=head2 TotalPaid

  @total = &TotalPaid ( $time, [$time2], [$spreadsheet ]);

Returns an array containing the payments and writeoffs made between two dates
C<$time> and C<$time2>, or on a specific one, or from C<$time> onwards.

C<$time> param is mandatory.
If C<$time> eq 'today', returns are limited to the current day
If C<$time2> eq '', results are returned from C<$time> onwards.
If C<$time2> is undef, returns are limited to C<$time>
C<$spreadsheet> param is optional and controls the sorting of the results.

Returns undef if no param is given
