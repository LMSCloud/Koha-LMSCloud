=head1 NAME

C4::Category - objects from the categories table

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use C4::Category;
    my @categories = C4::Category->all;
    print join("\n", map { $_->description } @categories), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class represent a row in the C<categories> table.

Currently, the bare minimum for using this as a read-only data source has
been implemented.  The API was designed to make it easy to transition to
an ORM later on.

=head2 Class Methods

=cut

=head3 C4::Category->new(\%opts)

Given a hashref, a new (in-memory) C4::Category object will be instantiated.
The database is not touched.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $opts) = @_;
    bless $opts => $class;
}




=head3 C4::Category->all

This returns all the categories as objects.  By default they're ordered by
C<description>.

=cut

sub all {
    my ( $class ) = @_;
    my $branch_limit = C4::Context->userenv ? C4::Context->userenv->{"branch"} : "";
    my $dbh = C4::Context->dbh;
    # The categories table is small enough for
    # `SELECT *` to be harmless.
    my $query = "SELECT categories.* FROM categories";
    $query .= qq{
        LEFT JOIN categories_branches ON categories_branches.categorycode = categories.categorycode
        WHERE categories_branches.branchcode = ? OR categories_branches.branchcode IS NULL
    } if $branch_limit;
    $query .= " ORDER BY description";
    return map { $class->new($_) } @{
        $dbh->selectall_arrayref(
            $query,
            { Slice => {} },
            $branch_limit ? $branch_limit : ()
        )
    };
}
