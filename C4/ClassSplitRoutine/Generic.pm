=head1 NAME

C4::ClassSplitRoutine::Generic - generic call number sorting key routine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use C4::ClassSplitRoutine;

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 split_callnumber

  my $cn_split = C4::ClassSplitRoutine::Generic::split_callnumber($cn_item);

  NOTE: Custom call number types go here. It may be necessary to create additional
  splitting algorithms if some custom call numbers cannot be made to work here.
  Presently this splits standard non-ddcn, non-lccn fiction and biography call numbers.
