    description: >

      This resource batch creates new transfer limits based on the given data.

      For example, if the paramters `to_library_id: 'BranchA'` and `item_type: 'BOOK'` are passed in
      new transfer limits for `BOOK`s will be created, with one transfer limit each for all the
      branches defined in Koha. Given 4 branches, 3 limits would be created:

      * to_library_id: 'BranchA', from_library_id: 'BranchB', item_type: 'BOOK'
      * to_library_id: 'BranchA', from_library_id: 'BranchC', item_type: 'BOOK'
      * to_library_id: 'BranchA', from_library_id: 'BranchD', item_type: 'BOOK'


      The body of the query would look like

      ```

      {
          'to_library_id': 'BranchA',
          'item_type': 'BOOK'

      }

      ```

      As another example, imagine we have an itemtype that is never supposed to be transferred to another library.
      If we call that itemtype `LOCAL_ONLY` we would need to just pass `item_type: 'LOCAL_ONLY'`, which would create transfer
      limits for all libraries, meaning those items would never be allowed to transfer to another
      library. The body of the query would look like

      ```

      {
          'item_type': 'LOCAL_ONLY'
      }

      ```
