=head1 DESCRIPTION

# Here is an example of a CAS Proxy
# The proxy is a foreign application that will authenticate the user against CAS
# Once authenticated as a proxy, the foreign application will be able to call some
# Koha webservices, proving authentication only by giving a proxy ticket

# Note: please keep in mind that all url's must be https and their certificates must be trusted
