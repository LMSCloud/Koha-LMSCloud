=head1 DESCRIPTION

# Here is an example of a simple phony webservice, returning "Hello World" if the user is authenticated
# The purpose is to show how CAS Proxy can work with koha
# In this configuration, this page acts as a CAS Client, instead of the user's browser.
# This page is meant to be called from a foreign application

=head1 CGI PARAMETERS

=item PT
The Proxy Ticket, needed for check_api_auth, that will try to make the CAS Server validate it.

=cut

# The authentication : if $cgi contains a PT parameter, and CAS is enabled (casAuthentication syspref),
# a CAS Proxy authentication will take place
