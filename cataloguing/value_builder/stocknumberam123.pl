=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is specific to AM123 but could be used as a base for similar operations.
It is used for stocknumber computation.

If the user send an empty string, we return a simple incremented stocknumber.
If a prefix is submited, we look for the highest stocknumber with this prefix, and return it incremented.
In this case, a stocknumber has this form : "PREFIX 0009678570".
 - PREFIX is an upercase word
 - a space separator
 - 10 digits, with leading 0s if needed
