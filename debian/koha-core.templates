Type: note
Description: koha-core upgrade actions required
 If you are upgrading from a Koha 3.2 to 3.4 release, you must run:
  sudo /usr/sbin/koha-upgrade-to-3.4
 .
 For large catalogues, running this may take a while. Your Koha installation
 should be largely operational during the process, but some things,
 particularly to do with items, may appear strange until the upgrade and
 re-index is complete.

Template: koha-core/automatically-update-translations
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: automatically update translations
  When Koha is upgraded, any existing translated templates can be regenerated
  to keep everything in sync. Select "yes" if you want this.

Template: koha-core/rename-apache-vhost-files
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Rename the Apache virtual hosts files for Koha instances?
 When Koha is upgraded, the Apache's virtual host definition files can be
 renamed to match the needs of the newer Apache 2.4. Previously defined
 Koha instances will get their Apache files appended '.conf'.
