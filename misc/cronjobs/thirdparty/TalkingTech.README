Installation and Setup instructions for Talking Tech I-tiva phone notification
=============================

Be sure you enabled the TalkingTechItivaPhoneNotification syspref and you created notice text for the Phone message transport type under the HOLD, PREDUE and OVERDUE notices. (See Tools > Notices and Slips.)

If you wish to process PREDUE or HOLD messages, you'll need the EnhancedMessagingPreferences system preference turned on, and patrons to have filled in a preference for receiving these notices by phone.

For OVERDUE messages, overdue notice triggers must be configured under Koha > Tools > Overdue Notice Triggers.
Either branch-specific triggers or the default level triggers may be used (script will select whichever is appropriate).


Sending Notices file to I-tiva:
=============================

1. Add the TalkingTech_itiva_outbound.pl script to your crontab
2. Add an FTP/SFTP or other transport method to send the output file to the I-tiva server
3. If you wish, archive the sent notices file in another directory after sending

Receiving Results file from I-tiva:
=============================

3. If you wish, archive the results file in another directory after processing
