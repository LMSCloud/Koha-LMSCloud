=head1 NAME

Koha::SVC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Call Koha's C</svc/> API to fetch/update records

This script can be used from other scripts as C<Koha::SVC> module or run
directly using syntax:

  koha-svc.pl http://koha-dev:8080/cgi-bin/koha/svc svc-user svc-password $biblionumber [bib-42.xml]

If called without last argument (MARCXML filename) it will fetch C<$biblionumber> from Koha and create
C<bib-$biblionumber.xml> file from it. When called with xml filename, it will update record in Koha.

This script is intentionally separate from Koha itself and dependencies which Koha has under
assumption that you might want to run it on another machine (or create custom script which mungles
Koha's records from other machine without bringing all Koha dependencies with it).

=head1 USAGE

This same script can be used as module (as it defines T<Koha::SVC> package) using

  require "koha-svc.pl"

at beginning of script. Rest of API is described below. Example of its usage is at beginning of this script.

=head2 new

  my $svc = Koha::SVC->new(
    url      => 'http://koha-dev:8080/cgi-bin/koha/svc',
    user     => 'svc-user',
    password => 'svc-password',
  );

URL must point to Koha's B<intranet> address and port.

Specified user must have C<editcatalogue> permission.
