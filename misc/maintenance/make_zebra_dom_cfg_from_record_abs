$0: generate a DOM filter Zebra index config from a GRS-1 config

Given a Zebra record.abs file containing a set of index definitions for
Zebra's GRS-1 filter, write an equivalent DOM filter configuration.

To generate the XSLT that is to be used by Zebra, run something like
the following on the output of this utility:

xsltproc ZEBRA_CFG_DIR/xsl/koha-indexdefs-to-zebra.xsl \\
  biblio-koha-indexdefs.xml \\
  > ZEBRA_CFG_DIR/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl

The above example assumes that the output of the program was named
biblio-koha-indexdefs.xsl.

Parameters:
    --input                 input file name
    --output                output file name
    --help or -h            show this message
_USAGE_
}
