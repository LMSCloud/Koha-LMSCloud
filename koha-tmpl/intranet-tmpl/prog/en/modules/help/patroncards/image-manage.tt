<p>Images must be under 500k in size.</p>

<p>Pictures uploaded with this tool should be at least 300dpi which is the minimum quality for a printable image.</p>

<p>In the center of the screen is a simple upload form, simply browse for the file on your computer and give it a name you'll recognize later.</p>

<p>Once the file is uploaded you will be presented with a confirmation message.</p>

<p>All uploaded images will be listed on the right hand side of this page.</p>

<p>To delete one or multiple of these images, click the checkbox to the right of each image you want to delete and click the 'Delete' button.</p>

<p>To replace an image, delete it, upload a new file and give it the same image name.</p>
