<h1>Serial Numbering Patterns</h1>

<p>Every time you create a new numbering pattern in serials you can save it for later use. These patterns are accessible via the Manage numbering patterns page.</p>

<p>This page will list for you the numbering patterns you have saved in the past as well as a few canned patterns.</p>

<p>It will also allow you to create a new numbering pattern without first adding a subscription. To add a new pattern click 'New numbering pattern' at the top of the list of patterns.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Serial Numbering Patterns in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/serials.html#manage-serial-numbering-patterns">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
