<h1>Plugins</h1>

<p>Koha's Plugin System allows for you to add additional tools and reports to Koha that are specific to your library.  Plugins are installed by uploading KPZ ( Koha Plugin Zip ) packages. A KPZ file is just a zip file containing the perl files, template files, and any other files necessary to make the plugin work.</p>

<p>The plugin system needs to be turned on by a system administrator and should only managed by those who understand Perl and the way data connects within Koha.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for the Plugin System in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/plugins.html">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
