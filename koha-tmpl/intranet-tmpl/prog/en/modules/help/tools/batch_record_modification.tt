</ul>
</li>
	<li>Finally choose the MARC Modification Template you'd like to use to edit these records.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've entered your criteria click 'Continue'</p>

<p>You will be presented with a list of records that will be edited. Next to each one is a checkbox so you can uncheck any items you would rather not edit at this time.</p>
