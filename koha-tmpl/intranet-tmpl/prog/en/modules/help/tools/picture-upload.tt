<h1>Upload patron images</h1>

<p>Patron images can be uploaded in bulk if you are allowing patron images to be attached to patron records. These images can also be used when creating patron cards.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a txt file and title it "DATALINK.TXT" or "IDLINK.TXT"</li>
	<li>On each line in the text file enter the patron's card number followed by comma (or tab) and then the image file name
<ul>
	<li>Make sure that your TXT file is a plain text document, not RTF.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Zip up the text file and the image files</li>
	<li>Go to the Upload Patron Images Tool</li>
	<li>For a single image, simply point to the image file and enter the patron card number</li>
	<li>For multiple images, choose to upload a zip file</li>
	<li>After uploading you will be presented with a confirmation</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#990000;">Important: There is a limit of 520K on the size of the picture uploaded and it is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images will work as well.</p>
