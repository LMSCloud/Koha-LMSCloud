<h1>Patron details</h1>

<p>When viewing a patron record you have the option to view information from one of many tabs found on the left hand side of the record.</p>

<h2>Check Out</h2>

<p>For instruction on checking items out click the Check Out tab and read the help file there.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>All patron information will appear on the Details tab. This includes all the contact information, notes, messaging preferences, etc entered when adding the patron. In the case of patrons who are marked as 'Child' or 'Professional' and their Guarantors additional information will appear on their record.</p>

<ul>
<li>A child patron will list their Guarantor</li>
<li>On the Guarantor's record, all children and/or professionals will be listed</li>
</ul>

<p>Below the patron's information on the details screen is a tabbed display of the items they have checked out, overdue, and on hold.</p>

<p>If they have family at the library staff can see what the other family members have checked out.</p>

<h2>Fines</h2>

<p>The patron's complete accounting history will appear on the Fines tab. Contrary to its name, the Fines tab does not just show fine data, it also shows membership fees, rental fees, reserve fees and any other charge you may have for patrons.</p>

<h2>Routing Lists</h2>

<p>A list of all of the serial routing lists the patron belongs to will be accessible via the 'Routing Lists' tab on the patron record.</p>

<p>On this tab you will be able to see and edit all of the routing lists that this patron is on.</p>

<h2>Circulation History</h2>

<p>The circulation history tab will appear if you have set the intranetreadinghistory preference to allow it to appear. If you have the OPACPrivacy system preference set to 'Allow' and the patron has decided that the library cannot keep this information this tab will only show currently checked out items.</p>

<h2>Modification Log</h2>

<p>If you have set your BorrowersLog to track changes to patron records, then this tab will appear. The Modification Log will show all changes made to the patron record.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Librarian field shows the patron number for the librarian who made the changes</li>
<li>The Object field lists the patron that is being modified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notices</h2>

<p>The patron's messaging preferences are set when adding or editing the patron. This tab will show the messages that have been sent and those that are queued to be sent</p>

<p>Clicking on the message title will expand the view to show you the full text of the message that was sent.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>Depending on what you set for the values of your StatisticsFields system preference, you can see statistics for one patron's circulation actions.</p>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>If you set the EnableBorrowerFiles preference to 'Do' the Files tab will be visible on the patron information page.</p>

<p>From here you can upload files to attach to the patron record.</p>

<p>All files that are uploaded will appear above a form where additional files can be uploaded from.</p>

<h2>Purchase Suggestions</h2>

<p>If the patron has made any purchase suggestions you will see a purchase suggestions tab on the patron record.</p>

<p>From here you can see all suggestions made by the patron and their status, you can also create a purchase suggestion on the patron's behalf by clicking the 'New purchase suggestion' button at the top.</p>

<p>Learn more about Purchase suggestions in the Acquisitions chapter of the manual.</p>

<h2>Patron discharges</h2>

<p>A discharge is a certificate that says the patron has no current checkouts, no holds and owe no money. To enable this option on the patron record you need to set the useDischarge system preference to 'Allow'.</p>

<p>Note: In France a "quitus" ("discharge") is needed if you want to register for an account in a library or a university).</p>

<p>Note: Academic libraries often require that you have a clear record at the library before you can graduate.</p>

<p>To generate a discharge for a patron click the 'Discharge' tab on the left of the patron record</p>

<p>If the patron can have a discharge generated then it will have a button that says 'Generate discharge'</p>

<p>If not then you'll see an error explaining why you can't discharge the patron.</p>

<p>Once the letter is generated you will have a PDF to download</p>

<h2>Editing Patrons</h2>

<p>Patrons in Koha can be edited using one of many edit buttons.</p>

	<li>To only change the patron's password, click the 'Change Password' button

</ul>
</li>
	<li>To edit a specific section of the patron record (for example the Library Use section) click the 'Edit' link below the section</li>

</ul>
</li>
	<li>Patrons can also be blocked from checking items out by setting Patron Flags
<ul>
	<li>If you would like your circulation staff to confirm a patron's address before checking items out to the patron, you can see the 'Gone no Address' flag</li>
    <li>If you would like to bar a patron from the library you can set the 'Restricted' flag
<ul>
    <li>This flag can automatically be set with the Overdue/Notice StatusTriggers</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
    <li>Children patrons do not become adults automatically in Koha. To upgrade a child patron to and adult patron category click on the 'More' menu and choose 'Update Child to Adult Patron'
<ul>
    <li>You will then be presented with a pop up window asking which one of your adult patron categories this Child should be updated to</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Duplicate a Patron</h2>

<p>Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to) change.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to duplicate information from)</li>
	<li>Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record</li>
	<li>All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number, opac login and opac password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing pieces and click 'Save'
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffe599;">TIP: Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will clear that field of all information (making it easier for you to type in something different)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>You will be brought to your new patron</li>
</ul>
