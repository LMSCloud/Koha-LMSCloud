<h1>Patron search</h1>

<p>Clicking on the link to the Patron module will bring you to a search/browse screen for patrons. From here you can search for a patron by any part of their name or their card number.</p>

<p>Clicking the small plus sign [+] to the right of the search box will open up an advanced patron search with more filters including the ability to limit to a specific category and/or library.</p>

<p>You can also filter your patron results using the search options on the left hand side of the page.</p>

<p>Depending on what you have chosen for the 'Search fields' you can search for patrons in various different ways.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Standard:
<ul>
	<li>Enter any part of their name, username, email address or barcode</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Email:
<ul>
	<li>Enter any part of their email address and choose 'Contains' instead of 'Starts with'</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Borrower number:
<ul>
	<li>Enter the Koha borrower number</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Phone number:
<ul>
	<li>Enter the phone number exactly as it is in the system or by using spaces between each batch of numbers.</li>
	<li>Example: To find (212) 555-1212 you can search for it exactly as it was entered or by searching for 212 555 1212</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Street address:
<ul>
	<li>Enter any part of the patron's address (includes all address fields) and choose 'Contains' instead of 'Starts with' to find the string anywhere in the address</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Date of birth
<ul>
	<li>Birthdates should be entered using the format set forth in the dateformat preference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sort field 1
<ul>
	<li>This is a custom field that libraries can use for any type of data about the patron.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sort field 2
<ul>
	<li>This is a custom field that libraries can use for any type of data about the patron.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also choose to either search for fields that start with the string you entered or contain the string. Choosing 'Contains' will work like a wildcard search.</p>

<p>You can also choose how your results will be sorted by using the 'Order by' pull down menu at the end of the form.</p>

<p>You can also browse through the patron records by clicking on the linked letters across the top.</p>
