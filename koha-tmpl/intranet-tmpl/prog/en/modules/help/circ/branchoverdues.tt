<h1>Overdues with fines</h1>

<p>This report will show you any overdues at your library that have accrued fines on them.</p>

<p>If you would like to limit the report you can use the pull down menu at the top to limit to a specific shelving location at your library. To see overdues with fines at other libraries you will have to change your library or log in at that library.</p>

<p style="color: #990000">Important: If you do not charge fines and/or don't have the fines cron job running you will see no data on this report.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Overdues with Fines in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/circulation.html#overdues-with-fines">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
