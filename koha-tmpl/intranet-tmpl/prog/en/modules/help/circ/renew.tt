<h1>Renew</h1>

<p>Checked out items can be renewed (checked out for another period of time) based on your circulation rules and renewal preferences.</p>

<p>To renew an item from this page you scan the barcodes of the items you would like to renew.</p>

<p>If the barcode is not found or the item is not actually checked out you will be presented with an error. Otherwise the item is renewed and you will receive a confirmation message.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Renewing in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/circulation.html#renewing">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
