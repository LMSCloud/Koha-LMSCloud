<h1>Checking out (Issuing)</h1>

<p>To check an item out to a patron, first search for that patron using one of the many options listed above. You will then be presented with the checkout screen.</p>

<p>If you have chosen to 'Always show checkouts immediately' then you will see the list of checkouts below the check out box.</p>

<p>At the top of the Check Out screen is a box for you to type or scan the item's barcode into.

<ul>
    <li style="color: #990000">Important: Many modern barcode scanners will send a 'return' to the browser, making it so that the 'Check Out' button is automatically clicked</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If the barcode is not found you will be prompted to use fast cataloging to add the item. Learn more about fast cataloging later in this manual.</li>
	<li>If you have itemBarcodeFallbackSearch set to 'Enable' then you can enter a keyword search in this box instead of just a barcode (this will make it possible to check out using title and/or call number).</li>
</ul>

<p>Below the box for the barcode you will see a checkbox for 'Automatic renewal'. This will allow this item to automatically renew if the appropriate cron job is running and there are no holds on the item.</p>

<p>Below the box for the barcode there may be options for you to override the default due date for the item.</p>

<ul>
	<li>This option will only appear if you have set the SpecifyDueDate system preference to allow staff to override the due date</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're allowing the checkout of items on site to patrons (these are usually items that are not for loan that you would like to check for in library use) then you will see the 'On-site checkout' checkbox.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page there is a summary of the patron's current checked out items along with the due date (and time if the item is an hourly loan), items checked out today will appear at the top.</p>

<p style="background-color: #ffe599"><strong>Tip</strong> If the checked out time is listed as 00:00 then the item is a daily loan item. The due time for daily checkouts will show 23:59 which is the last minute of the day.</p>

<p>If you checked out an item for on site use you will see that highlighted in red in the checkout summary.</p>

<p>If you have set your ExportCircHistory preference, you will also see the option to export the patron's current checkout information using a CSV Profile or ISO2709 (MARC21) format.</p>

<p>Also at the bottom of the page is the list of items the patron has on hold</p>

<p>From the holds list you can suspend or resume patrons holds using the options at the bottom of the list if you have the SuspendHoldsIntranet preference set to 'allow.'</p>

<p>Note: If you have your AutoResumeSuspendedHolds preference set to "Don't allow" then you will not have the option to put an end date on the hold suspension.</p>

<p>If there are notes on the patron record these will appear to the right of the checkout box</p>

<p>If the patron has a hold waiting at the library that too will appear to the right of the check out box making it easy for the circulation librarian to see that there is another item to give the patron</p>

<p>The details of the checkouts will appear on the bib detail page in the staff client as well.</p>

<h3>Printing Receipts</h3>

<p>Once you have checked out all of the items for the patron you can print them a receipt by choosing one of two methods.</p>

<p>If you have the CircAutoPrintQuickSlip preference set to 'open a print quick slip window' or 'open a print slip window' you can simply hit enter on your keyboard or scan a blank piece of paper with your barcode scanner. The idea being that you're "checking out" a blank barcode which triggers Koha to print the 'Quick slip' or the 'Slip.'</p>

<p>You can also click the Print button at the top of the screen and choose 'Print slip' or 'Print quick slip'.</p>

<p>If you choose 'Print slip' it will print all of the items the patron has checked out, including those they checked out at an earlier date. Choosing 'Print quick slip' will print only the items that were checked out today.</p>

<p>What prints on the slips can be customized by altering the slip templates under the Notices & Slips tool.</p>

<h3>Clear Patron Information</h3>

<p>When you're done checking an item out if you have the DisplayClearScreenButton preference set to 'Show' you can clear the current patron by clicking the X in the top right of the patron's info to remove the current patron from the screen and start over.</p>

<p>If you have the CircAutoPrintQuickSlip preference set to 'clear the screen' then you simply need to hit enter or scan a blank barcode and the screen will be cleared of the current patron.</p>

<h2>Check Out Messages</h2>

<p>If you check out an item that has multiple pieces and you have cataloged that information in subfield 3 of the item record (in MARC21) a message will pop up when you check out that item telling you how many pieces should be there.</p>

<p>There are times when Koha will prevent the librarian from being able to check out items to a patron. When this happens a warning will appear notifying the librarian of why the patron cannot check items out.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Patron owes too much in fines
<ul>
	<li>You can set the amount at which patron checkouts are blocked with the noissuescharge system preference</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Patron has a restriction on their account
<ul>
    <li>This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and adding a restriction or by the Overdue/Notice Status Triggers</li>

    <li>If the staff member has the right permission they can override the restriction temporarily</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Patron needs to confirm their address
<ul>
	<li>This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and adding a flag</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Patrons has lost their library card
<ul>
	<li>This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and adding a flag</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Out Warnings</h2>

<p>Sometimes checkouts will trigger warning messages that will appear in a yellow box above the check out field. These warnings need to be acknowledged before you will be able to continue checking items out.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Patron has outstanding fines</li>
	<li>Item on hold for someone else</li>
	<li>Item should be on the hold shelf waiting for someone else</li>
	<li>Item already checked out to this patron</li>
	<li>Item checked out to another patron</li>
	<li>Item not for loan</li>
	<li>Patron has too many things checked out</li>
	<li>Item cannot be renewed
<ul>
	<li>This can be overridden with the AllowRenewalLimitOverride system preference</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Barcode not found
<ul>
    <li>Learn more about fast cataloging later in this file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Item being checked out is marked as 'lost'
<ul>
    <li>Depending on the value in your IssueLostItem preference, you may just see a warning or a confirmation box</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Item being checked out is not recommended for a patron of this age</li>
    <li>Item being checked out meets the decreaseLoanHighHolds system preference criteria</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fast Add Cataloging</h2>

<p>Sometimes circulation librarians need to quickly add a record to the system for an item they are about to check out. This is called 'Fast Add.' To allow circulation librarians access to the Fast Add Cataloging tool, simply make sure they have the fast_cataloging permissions. There are two ways to add titles via fast add. If you know that you're about to check out an item that isn't in you catalog you can go to the Circulation module and click 'Fast cataloging.'</p>

<p>The cataloging interface will open up with the short cataloging record</p>

<p>After adding your cataloging data you will be asked to enter item data. Enter the items barcode, collection code, etc and save the item before checking it out.</p>

<p>The other way to fast catalog is from the checkout screen. When you enter a barcode at checkout that Koha can't find, it will prompt you to use fast cataloging to add the item to Koha and check it out.</p>

<p>Clicking 'Fast cataloging' will bring you to the fast cataloging form where you can enter the title information</p>

<p>After clicking 'Save' you will be brought to the item record where the barcode will already be filled in with the barcode you're trying to check out.</p>

<p>After clicking the 'Add item' button the item will automatically be checked out the patron you were trying to check the book out to originally.</p>

<h2>Circulation Messages</h2>

<p>Circulation messages are short messages that librarians can leave for their patrons or their colleagues that will appear at the time of circulation.</p>

<h3>Setting up Messages</h3>

<p>Circulation messages are set up as Authorized Values. To add or edit Circulation Messages you want to work with the BOR_NOTES value.</p>

<h3>Adding a Message</h3>

<p>When on the patron's check out tab you will see a link to 'Add a new message' to the right of the check out box.</p>

<p>When you click 'Add a new message' you will be asked to choose if the message is for the librarians or the patron and the message you would like to leave.</p>

<h3>Viewing Messages</h3>

<p>Circulation messages meant for the staff will appear on the patron's checkout screen.</p>

<p>Circulation messages meant for the patron will appear when they log into the OPAC.</p>
