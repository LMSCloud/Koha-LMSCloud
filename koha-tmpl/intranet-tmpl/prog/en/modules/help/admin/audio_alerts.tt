<h1>Audio alerts</h1>

<p>This section of Koha lets you specify a given sound to play when a given jQuery selector is matched.</p>

<p><em>Note: Use system preference 'AudioAlerts' to enable/disable sounds.</em><p>

<h2>Adding a new alert</h2>

<p>To add a new alert:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Locate the "Add new alert" form.</li>
    <li>
        Enter a selector in the "selector" input, you can see documentation on jQuery selectors <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">here</a>.
        For example, if you use the selector "#circ_impossible" your selected sound will be triggered when a checkout for a patron is not possible (such as the barcode not being found).
    <li>Enter a sound to be played, you can either select a built-in Koha sound using the pulldown selector, or you can enter a full URL to a sound file on another server.</li>
    <li>At this point, you can preview your sound by clicking the "Play sound" button</li>
    <li>Click "Save alert" and your done!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sound precedence</h2>

<p>Sounds will be played in order from top to bottom. That is, the first select that finds a match will have its sound played.</p>

<p>To change the precedence of a given alert, use the four arrows to move it up, down, or to the top or bottom of the list.</o>

<h2>Deleting alerts</h2>

<p>To delete one or more alerts, check the checkboxes for those alerts you wish to delete, then click the "Delete selected alerts" button and confirm you want to delete those alerts.
