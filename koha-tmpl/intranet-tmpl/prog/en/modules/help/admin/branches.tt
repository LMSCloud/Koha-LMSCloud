<h1>Libraries &amp; Groups</h1>

<p>When setting up your Koha system you will want to add information for every library that will be sharing your system. This data is used in several areas of Koha.</p>

<p>When visiting this page you are presented with a list of the libraries and groups that have already been added to the system.</p>

<h2>Adding a Library</h2>

<p>To add a new library:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Click 'New Library'</li>
	<li>The top of the form asks for some basics about the library
<ul>
	<li>The library code should not contain any spaces and be 10 or fewer characters. This code will be used as a unique identifier in the database.</li>
	<li>The name will be displayed on the OPAC wherever the library name displays to the public and should be a name that makes sense to your patrons.</li>
	<li>If you have groups set up you can choose what group this library belongs to after entering in the code and name</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Next you can enter basic contact info about the branch
<ul>
	<li>The address and contact fields can be used to make notices custom for each library</li>
	<li>The email address field is not required, but it should be filled for every library in your system
<ul>
	<li style="color: #990000;">Important: Be sure to enter a library email address to make sure that notices are sent to and from the right address</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If you'd like you can enter a different 'Reply-To' email address. This is the email address that all replies will go to.
<ul>
	<li>Tip: If you do not fill in this value Koha will use the address in the ReplytoDefault preference</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If you'd like you can also enter a different 'Return-Path' email address. This is the email address that all bounced messages will go to.
<ul>
	<li>Tip: If you do not fill in this value Koha will use the address in the ReturnpathDefault preference</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If the URL field is populated then the library name will be linked in the holdings table on the OPAC</li>
	<li>The OPAC Info box is for you to put information about the library that will appear in the OPAC when the branch name is moused over in the holdings table</li>
	<li>IP Address does not have be filled in unless you plan on limiting access to your staff client to a specific IP Address
<ul>
	<li style="color: #990000;">Important: An IP address is required if you have enabled AutoLocation</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Finally, if you have any notes you can put them here. These will not show in the OPAC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="background-color: #ffe599;">Tip: Of the fields listed, only 'Library code' and 'Name' are required</p>

<h2>Editing/Deleting a Library</h2>

<p>You will be unable to delete any library that has patrons or items attached to it.</p>

<p>Each library will have an 'Edit' link to the right of it. Click this link to edit/alter details associated with the library in question.</p>

<p>You will be unable to edit the 'Library code'</p>

<h2>Adding a group</h2>

<p>To add a Search Domain or Library Property Group click the 'New Group' button at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>Of the fields on the group form, 'Category code' and 'Name' are the only required fields</p>

<h2>Search Domain Groups</h2>

<p>Search Domain Groups allow you to search a group of libraries at the same time instead of searching just one library or all libraries.</p>

<p>To see Search Domain Groups in action visit the staff client advanced search page in your Koha system</p>

<h2>Library Property Groups</h2>

<p>You can assign specific categories to your libraries by adding groups for them.</p>

<p>Properties are then applied to libraries via the add or edit library form.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Libraries &amp; Groups in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/administration.html#libraries-&-groups">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
