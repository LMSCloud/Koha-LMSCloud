# This script search in items table if a value for a given field exists.
# It is used in check_additem (additem.js)
# Parameters are a list of 'field', which must be field names in items table
# and a list of 'value', which are the corresponding value to check
# Eg. @field = ('barcode', 'barcode', 'stocknumber')
#     @value = ('1234', '1235', 'ABC')
#     The script will check if there is already an item with barcode '1234',
#     then an item with barcode '1235', and finally check if there is an item
#     with stocknumber 'ABC'
# It returns a JSON string which contains what have been found
# Eg. { barcode: ['1234', '1235'], stocknumber: ['ABC'] }
